# Hello 👋

Hi, I’m Karishma.

I started coding young, and over the last few years, I’ve built e-commerce platforms, CRM systems, mobile apps, and backends. I don’t limit myself to one role; if a project needs frontend, backend, mobile, testing, or even SEO, I’ll figure it out and deliver.

Some wins
- Built and shipped a mobile MVP in 2 months with real users.
- Managed and scaled 3 e-commerce sites solo (yes, in JSP).
- Delivered projects reliably while balancing work, study, and side jobs.

How I work
I pick up new stacks quickly, stay consistent, and don’t overcomplicate things. If you give me a project, I’ll make sure it moves forward.
