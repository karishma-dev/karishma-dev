# Hello 👋

Since I started coding at 17, my goal has been simple: to become the developer a project needs. I began my career as a high school student, tasked with developing an e-commerce website. With over 3 years of professional experience, I've consistently evolved into a reliable, full-stack professional. Over an extended period, I became the go-to person for a major e-commerce client, and my clients know I'm someone they can count on.

My work isn't just about writing code; it's about solving real-world problems.

Key Accomplishments
- Sole developer on multiple projects, including a marketplace e-commerce website and a CRM system.
- Removed 90% of technical debt in a CRM and also designed its UI/UX, ensuring it could function offline for sales reps.
- Developed and deployed robust backend services, including scalable REST APIs, and automated CI/CD pipelines using Docker.

As a computer science student at BITS Pilani, I'm constantly learning and expanding my skills. If you need a reliable developer who can wear many hats, deliver high-quality work, and isn't afraid of a challenge, let's connect.
