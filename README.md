# Hello 👋

Greetings!

I have always been fascinated by Computer Science since I was a child. A few years ago, I realised that my passion for programming and problem-solving could become a fulfilling career. However, I soon learned that there is much more to learn in this field beyond what is taught in school. I started learning to program when I was ten years old, thanks to the school curriculum that introduced me to the Logo programming language. But at that time, I had not yet decided what specific area of programming I wanted to pursue. 

Later, during the COVID pandemic, I stumbled upon the FreeCodeCamp website while homeschooling due to personal issues, and that is when my actual learning journey began. I got deeply involved in learning Web Development. What started as frontend curiosity with React and JavaScript has grown into a full-stack experience over the past 3 years. I've worked across the entire development spectrum - from building responsive UIs and React Native mobile apps to developing backend APIs with Node.js and managing cloud deployments.

Some highlights from my journey: I've led the development of e-commerce platforms and CRM systems, built mobile apps from scratch, and even created offline-capable applications. Currently working part-time at CreativeScript, managing multiple projects, and I'm open to remote freelance work and full-time opportunities, which keeps me on my toes and constantly learning.

I am a naturally curious person and enjoy reading books on various topics. Feel free to connect with me if you want to chat about tech, books or anything.
