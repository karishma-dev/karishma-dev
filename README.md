# Hello 👋

I’m a Product Engineer working across web, mobile, and backend systems.

Over the past few years, I’ve owned and maintained production e-commerce platforms, CRM systems, and mobile applications - handling everything from frontend architecture to backend services and release pipelines.

I enjoy building structured systems, thinking through product decisions carefully, and making sure what gets shipped remains stable as it grows.

My work tends to involve improving foundations - architecture, UX clarity, performance, and maintainability - so teams can build confidently on top of it.

Currently open to freelance and contract opportunities with product teams and startups.
